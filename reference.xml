      <p>The platform that you’ll be using to create your blog is called Wix. Wix is a web hosting
        platform that allows you to host your own web address/domain, create web sites using drag
        and drop tools or from scratch, using customizable templates along with apps, graphics,
        image galleries, and fonts, and editing certain features of the website including the way in
        which articles appear on the page, the color of text and buttons, the font size, the
        placement for links to other articles, and the size of thumbnail images related to
        posts.</p>
      <p>The feature of the Wix platform that you’ll be using to perform this operation is the Blog
        app, which is located on the main page of the Wix site after you log in. This feature allows
        you to write articles with images or videos for posting now or at a later point in time. It
        also allows you to edit text in articles, change spacing of text, adjust style of font, and
        control the text and font size as you would using Microsoft Word or any standard word
        processing program.</p>
