  <title>What is a personal blog?</title>
  <shortdesc>What is a blog?</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>A blog is defined as a personal website consisting of short, informal entries.</p>
    <p>Many blogs can be personal in nature, although a great deal of them typically revolve around
      a certain topic such as politics, music, sports, and entertainment.</p>
    <p>A blog usually combines text and images, links to other websites, and media which is related
      to the general topic. While they're considered to be primarily textual in nature, some blogs
      have very little textual accompaniment and are dedicated entirely to fields such as art,
      photography, videos, MP3's, and podcasts.</p>
